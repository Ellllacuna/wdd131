            <h2>2 Nephi 4:2</h2>
            <p>For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed.
                 And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many
                  greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our 
                  future generations; and they are written upon the 
                  plates of brass.</p>

                 obtain the kingdom; wherefore, Moron dwelt in 
                 captivity all the remainder of his days; and he
                  begat Coriantor.</p>
